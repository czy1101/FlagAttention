"""Ascend HY3 decode, split by the leaf format the KV cache holds.

``bf16`` is the BF16 implementation, ``fp8`` the FP8 one, ``mtp_reduce`` the
split reduction chain both of them launch at MTP>=2, and ``launch`` the host-side
launch fast path the FP8 entry uses.  This package re-exports the BF16 entries so
that the ``static`` and ``dynamic`` wrappers keep importing them from here.
